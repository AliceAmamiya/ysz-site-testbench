abstract: This paper examines the development and trajectory of Computational Social Sciences (CSS) in China over the past decade. It evaluates empirical indicators such as the number of grants awarded, publications, and the establishment of CSS programs in Chinese universities. The analysis reveals a significant increase in interest and investment in CSS, driven largely by the country's expansive internet user base and advancements in big data analytics. While CSS has not yet established common practices akin to more mature fields, its interdisciplinary nature and rapid growth suggest a burgeoning field with substantial future potential. The paper concludes by reflecting on the theoretical positioning of CSS within the broader landscape of social science research..
